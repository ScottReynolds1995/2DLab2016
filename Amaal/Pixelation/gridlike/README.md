# Extensions

- Modify `BlankCell` so that it can have an explicit size. What about colour?
- How would we build a `NoiseCell`?
- The code from last week: build a blend cell and a downsample cell
- Resizing: constrain a child cell to a fixed size. With and without aspect ratio retention.
- Implement some CSS-like stylings:
  - Padding, border, margin (wrapped around a contained cell)
- Processing cells:
  - MixCell which combines two other cells: crossfade, diagonal divide, ...
  - MonoCell which produces a black-and-white version of its contents
  - Mask cell: combine two cells according to a mask which is the third cell
- Classifying and sorting cells:
  - Add tags
  - Filter, group, sort by tags
  - Add sets/collections
  - Add dates
